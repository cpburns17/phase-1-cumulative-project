# phase-1-cumulative-project
End of Flatiron Phase 1 project.

We can edit this read me to be more presentable later on. Lets just use this to write out our thinking for now.

Our initial idea is to create a bunch of questions that ask for adjective, verb, and noun inputs that will be placed into a set of sentences to create a story (maybe we create a variety of each sentence in order to make each story a little more unique?). The event listeners that we will use are submit (submission of words, and submission of comments to previous stories), click (options to like each story that has been submitted), and mouseover (hold mouse over each story to see the adverbs used, or if not, well figure some other way to use). 

If we can figure it out, we would like to use AI to generate an image based off of each sentence created. 

The purpose of our project is entertainment, as well as the ability to share created stories with all users visiting the site.
