# phase-1-cumulative-project
End of Flatiron Phase 1 project.

We can edit this read me to be more presentable later on. Lets just use this to write out our thinking for now.

Our initial idea is to create a bunch of questions that ask for adjective, verb, and noun inputs that will be placed into a set of sentences to create a story (maybe we create a variety of each sentence in order to make each story a little more unique?). The event listeners that we will use are submit (submission of words, and submission of comments to previous stories), click (options to like each story that has been submitted), and mouseover (hold mouse over each story to see the adverbs used, or if not, well figure some other way to use). 

If we can figure it out, we would like to use AI to generate an image based off of each sentence created. 

The purpose of our project is entertainment, as well as the ability to share created stories with all users visiting the site.


Story:

This year, my family is hosting Thanksgiving at my sister's house. She always makes a big deal about bringing a gift or dish, so this year I decided to bring a __noun(singular)__ . Last year, my brother brought a __noun(singulr)__, and my sister was NOT happy.

As the day approached, I carefully prepared my surprise dish, a secret weapon to dazzle the family taste buds. The anticipation grew as I  __verb(past tence)__ on my way to my sister's home, armed with my mysterious creation. Little did they know, a culinary masterpiece awaited them.

Since my brother's last attempt at culinary creativity had left a mark, my sister was determined to avoid a repeat. However, as I unveiled my surprise dish, the room fell silent, and all eyes turned toward the table. The atmosphere was __adjective__. 

To everyone's surprise, my dish turned out to be __adjective__ ! The unique flavors and textures were a __adjective__ addition to the traditional spread. This Thanksgiving, my unexpected contribution became a highlight, turning the table into a feast of culinary surprises.
